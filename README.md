# Character Recognition Using KNN

This repository contains a project on character recognition using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to classify handwritten characters based on pixel features, aiding in optical character recognition (OCR) tasks.

## Project Overview

Character recognition is a common application in optical character recognition systems, which are widely used for digitizing printed or handwritten documents. In this project, the KNN algorithm is implemented to classify characters based on pixel intensities.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: MNIST or a similar character dataset.
- **Features**: Each character is represented by pixel intensity values.
- **Target**: 10 classes (for digits) or 26 classes (for alphabetic characters).

## Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**: for implementing the KNN algorithm and evaluation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: for visualizations

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalized pixel values to enhance model performance.
   - Split data into training and test sets.

2. **Model Training**
   - Implemented the KNN algorithm using scikit-learn.
   - Explored different values of K to identify the optimal number of neighbors.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Performance was measured using accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Confusion matrix and accuracy metrics were used for model evaluation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Experimented with different K values to optimize performance.

## Results

The KNN model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (update with your actual accuracy) on the test dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/character-recognition-knn.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the KNN algorithm can be used for character recognition tasks. Further improvements could involve more advanced algorithms for enhanced accuracy in real-world applications.
